### (Getting Into)
## CPython Core Development

Nick Coghlan (@ncoghlan_dev)

CPython core developer<br/>(since 2005)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### The CPython Code Base

* Total commits: 100k+ (Github stats)
* Total contributors: 1760+ (Misc/ACKS)
* First commit: August 5th, 1990 (~27 years ago)
* Python lines: ~530k code, ~120k comments
* C lines: ~390k code, ~50k comments

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Where to start?</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Start with "Why?"

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Python core development covers a broad range of activities</li>
<li>Your personal motivations for getting involved thus have a big
impact on where it makes sense to start</li>
<li>Participation is mostly about intrinsic rewards rather than external
ones, so knowing why you started is also key to knowing when to stop</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Acknowledge the timelines

* Maintenance releases ~6 months
* Feature releases every 18-24 months
* Redistributors may add weeks or months of latency
* Platforms may add years of latency (e.g. LTS Linux)
* Workflow tools aspire to continuous deployment!

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>CPython&#39;s release cadence is not fast, so if you&#39;re looking for instant
gratification, contributing to the workflow tools may be of more interest
than CPython itself</li>
<li>Personally, I find the slow cadence relaxing - there&#39;s almost always time to
discuss ideas and consider them from multiple angles, and because there
aren&#39;t any road map commitments, we can always slip changes to a later release</li>
<li>The maintenance process for the workflow tools also more closely resembles
typical network service development in an organisation, whereas a language
runtime like CPython faces all sorts of additional considerations</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Patience is Required

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>While some core developers do get paid to contribute to CPython, they&#39;re
usually only paid to focus on specific features and bug fixes of interest
to their employers</li>
<li>This means mentoring new contributors comes out of people&#39;s personal time,
and hence may only be intermittently available</li>
<li>Meeting core devs in person, whether at a post-conference development sprint,
or a local meetup like this one, tends to help get priority attention for
the time we devote to that task</li>
<li>Aside from that, you&#39;re relying on a combination of luck (sometimes an issue
report just happens to catch our interest), self-interest (we&#39;re more likely
to follow up if someone tries to resolve an issue we reported), and explicitly
assumed responsibilities (modules with designated experts in the developer
guide are more likely to receive attention)</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Some<br/>Motivations

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>I can&#39;t even conceive of all the possible reasons someone might want to
contribute to CPython, but there are a few recurring ones</li>
<li>So I&#39;ll present this in the form of example motivations, and some steps
towards get started given that motivation</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### The docs have this<br/>minor error...

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Simple documentation fixes are one of the easiest places to get started,
simply because you can do it entirely through the web browser</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Step 1:<br/>Find the source page on GitHub

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>CPython&#39;s source repo is on GitHub these days, and one of the main benefits
that offers is through-the-browser editing for documentation fixes</li>
<li>The Doc directory layout mirrors the HTML layout on docs.python.org</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Step 2:<br/>Make your edits

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Once you find the page of interest, you can hit the Edit icon, and Github
will automatically fork the repo and create a working branch for you</li>
<li>The in-browser text editor isn&#39;t wonderful, but it&#39;s good enough for basic
tasks link typo fixes, updating links, and so forth</li>
<li>For more complex updates, documentation updates are handled like any other
bug (which I&#39;ll get into next)</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Step 3:<br/>Submit your PR

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Once your finish your edits, GitHub lets you easily turn them into a PR
against the main CPython repo</li>
<li>This will kick off several automated checks, and will complain that a NEWS
entry and issue reference are missing. For simple typo fixes, the reviewer
will add labels to tell the bot that&#39;s OK. For more complex changes, the
reviewer may ask you to create an issue explaining the motivation for the
change.</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### I have this bug...

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>When your Python code is broken, you probably <em>haven&#39;t</em> found a bug in
the interpreter or the standard library</li>
<li>Nevertheless, our open issue count is already over 6000, and it&#39;s steadily
growing</li>
<li>Ensuring that future you doesn&#39;t have to deal with the same problems as
current you is a time-honoured motivation for getting involved in an open
source project</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Step 1:<br/>Build CPython

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>This step is the main focus of the Quick Start at the beginning of the
CPython Developer Guide (I&#39;ll provide a link to that at the end)</li>
<li>The Quick Start aims to take you through the process of cloning the main
CPython git repo, building it locally on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux, and
then running the test suite to make sure your build works</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Step 2:<br/>Add a new test case

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>All the tests live in Lib/tests, even those that are testing base
interpreter functionality</li>
<li>Confusingly, the test layout still mostly follows the Python 2.x stdlib
layout, since it&#39;s a lot easier to break things without noticing when
refactoring tests than it is when refactoring tested code</li>
<li>I mostly just look for existing tests that call into the code I&#39;m intending
to change, and fit my new test case in there</li>
<li>Almost all of the tests are written in Python</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Step 3:<br/>Make the change

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>It can be helpful to post your draft test case to whatever issue you&#39;re
trying to fix, in order to get feedback on whether or not it actually
specifies the desired behaviour</li>
<li>Regardless of whether or you do that or not, the next step is to actually
make the change</li>
<li>The pure Python code for the standard library is all in the Lib subdirectory</li>
<li>The C code is split across Programs, Python, Objects, and Modules, and the
distinctions between the latter 3 can get a bit blurry</li>
<li>Code searching tools are an essential aid. I personally use Eli Bendersky&#39;s
pss utility, but anything that will let you easily search a directory tree
for all occurrences of a particular symbol will do the trick</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Step 4:<br/>Submit your PR

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>There are a few more steps to this when it comes to code changes, but the
developer guide takes you through the process</li>
<li>The big difference is that you have to push your local changes up to your
CPython fork on GitHub, then submit the PR based on that</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### I'm curious<br/>and I learn by doing...

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Sometimes folks are interested in participating in core development, but
first need to find something interesting to work on</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Step 1a:<br/>look for "easy" bugs

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>The issue tracker has a link on the sidebar for &quot;easy&quot; issues. These are
issues that are considered sufficiently well-defined that a new contributor
can take them on with the assistance of the developer guide</li>
<li>We also have a separated tag for easy C issues, since they may be easy for
folks that already know C, but they&#39;re decidedly <em>not</em> easy if you need to
learn it in the process</li>
<li>This option is especially appropriate for folks that are not only new to
CPython core development, but also new to software development in general</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Step 1b:<br/>look for old bugs

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>For experienced developers, David Murray suggests an alternative approach,
which is to browse the entire open issues list, starting with the <em>oldest</em>
open issue</li>
<li>These issues have usually been open for a long time for a reason, but reading
the discussion can be quite educational, and sometimes you&#39;ll even find that
they&#39;ve actually been resolved since they were last looked at, but nobody
went back and closed the issue</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Step 2:<br/>Proceed as for<br/>"I have this bug..."

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>When you work on resolving an issue we usually don&#39;t ask too many questions
about why you care</li>
<li>&quot;It looks interesting and it&#39;s been open for a long time&quot; is just as valid a
reason for caring as &quot;I recently hit this in my own code&quot;</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### I'm more interested<br/>in the design process...

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>This is how I personally became involved in the core development process</li>
<li>I discovered comp.lang.python back when Usenet was still a thing, and from
there discovered the python-dev mailing list</li>
<li>Listening to folks like Tim Peters and Raymond Hettinger discuss trade-offs
in the design of different data types, or Marc-Andre Lemburg and Martin von
Loewis discuss Unicode was fascinating and educational, but it was something
superficially trivial that got me to cross the line into becoming a
contributor myself: creating the first version of the -m switch in order to
make the timeit module easier to run from the command line</li>
<li>Raymond Hettinger accepted the first version of that for Python 2.4, and then
I helped out with benchmarking and iterating on the initial implementation of
the pure Python decimal module (ask me about the integer conversion
performance hack arising from that, and things grew from there</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Step 1:<br/>Browse the historical PEPs

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Python&#39;s design process has long been an open one, and since the release of
Python 2.0 in 2000, major design decisions have been tracked through the
Python Enhancement Proposal process</li>
<li>Reading accepted and final PEPs can provide a guide as to which kinds of
design arguments tend to be convincing</li>
<li>rejected and withdrawn ones provide a repository of concepts which have been
deemed unsuitable for Python (at least in the specific form presented by that
particular PEP)</li>
<li>open and deferred PEPs provide insight into currently open design questions</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Step 2:<br/>Sign up for python-dev

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>This is the main list where items get escalated from the issue tracker if we
can&#39;t come to a clear consensus on the suitability of a change there</li>
<li>It&#39;s also the main list for final PEP reviews, where Guido or his delegate
makes the determination on whether to accept a proposal or not</li>
<li>Usually only moderate traffic, but can spike significantly when a particularly
controversional proposal comes up and seems likely to be accepted</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Step 3:<br/>Sign up for python-ideas<br/>(optional!)

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>This is a brainstorming list that&#39;s deliberately more receptive to outlandish
ideas than the main python-dev list</li>
<li>We set it up because even outlandish ideas can sometimes have a good idea, or
at least a valid problem report, hidden inside them, but asking &quot;Is there
a potentially good idea here?&quot; is a different question from python-dev&#39;s more
abrupt &quot;Is this a good idea for CPython at this point in time? Yes or no?&quot;</li>
<li>I find the list quite enjoyable most of the time, but you do need to be
prepared to ignore threads that have devolved into esoteric silliness that
has no chance of ever being accepted into the language</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Step 4:<br/>Sign up for python-checkins<br/>(optional!)

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>This is a high traffic list that receives a notification for <em>every</em>
accepted change into the CPython code base</li>
<li>I read it consistently for several years after I became a core dev, but
haven&#39;t even tried for the past few years</li>
<li>If you have the time though, it can be an incredibly good way to get a sense
of which parts of the CPython code base are being actively worked on, and
who&#39;s specifically working on them</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### I just want to help somehow...

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>While CPython and standard library changes eventually reach an enormous
audience, they&#39;ll often take years to get there</li>
<li>Other projects are often more in need of help than we are, and any changes
you contribute can be rolled out more quickly</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Idea 1:<br/>Python Packaging Authority

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>CPython bundles the <code>pip</code> package manager</li>
<li>packaging.python.org is the Python Packaging User Guide</li>
<li>pypi.org is a deployment of the new Warehouse service intended to replace
the legacy index service as pypi.python.org</li>
<li>these projects affect a similarly broad audience to Python itself, but on
a faster timeline, since they can be upgraded independently of the underlying
Python version</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Idea 2:<br/>Roundup Issue Tracker

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>This is the issue tracker that powers bugs.python.org</li>
<li>Changes can be made either upstream (preferred), or specifically to
the CPython deployment at bugs.python.org</li>
<li>This handles a fair bit of the integration between GitHub and other python-dev
and PSF workflows</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Idea 3:<br/>Buildbot CI Service

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>This is the CI service that powers CPython&#39;s post-merge CI</li>
<li>Allows us to test on architectures and operating systems beyond the basic
set of Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X on x86-64 that cloud services offer</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Idea 4:<br/>PyPI Backports

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>A number of standard library modules have counterparts on PyPI that provide
access to APIs from later CPython releases on newer CPython versions</li>
<li>Helping out with these can be a good way to build trust with a standard
library module maintainer if there&#39;s a particular module you&#39;d like to
propose enhancements to</li>
