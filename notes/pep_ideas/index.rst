PEP Ideas: Free to a good home
==============================

My ability to generate ideas for ways in which Python could potentially be
improved in various areas vastly outstrips the time I'm willing to spend
following up on them, kicking them around with other community members and
turning them into suggestions that may actually prove to be a genuine
enhancement to the language rather than just useless cruft new Python
programmers have to learn in order to understand code other programmers might
write.

As a result, there are plenty of ideas I've had that may actually
have some merit, but that I don't have the time to explore. Be aware that
some of these are going to be *bad* ideas that justifiably won't survive the
gauntlet of python-ideas and python-dev review, while others may make sense
as esoteric PyPI modules rather than as standard library or core language
additions.

.. note: Several of these articles are just placeholders for the moment. In
   those cases, they have a link to relevant python-ideas posts or past blog
   posts. Explore a little - these are generally things I've written a fair
   bit about in the past.
